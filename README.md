This project introduces a method to design LLMs for language learning by constraining their output from an architectural perspective to a predefined vocabulary set, such as A1 proficiency words.
The constraints are formulated as a word graph, inspired from finite-state machine and paper A General-Purpose Algorithm for Constrained Sequential Inference (Deutsch et al., 2019). Dynamic masking is achieved in the beam search decoding function by pruning tokens logits. Input-dependent tokens to prune are obtained by the transitions of the word graph matchiing state. Additionally, the beam search method is tested to improve the output quality.

The image illustrates a word graph for "cat". The states represent intermediate token combinations, and transitions represent allowed tokens to reach another state along a valid path. The notation "*" stands for special tokens.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/epfl-dlab/difficulty_constrained_decoding.git
   cd difficulty_constrained_decoding
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install Pynini (optionnal):
   
Pynini is a library that supports finite-state transducers, it was tested for the word graph implementation. The word graph was finally constructed from a custom trie-based structure, which was more efficient.

## Usage

Run the top-level script, and follow indications in the command line to run the different implementations.

```bash
python run.py
```

Specifically, you can choose between:
1. Run constrained decoding (final implementation)
2. Run tasks (1-10)
